Forgive this... its a work in progress, but it does mostly work. mostly. 

### 1. Add Flask API Endpoint (5-10 minutes)

**File:** `app.py` on your Flask server

Add the `/api/flare-status` endpoint. See `flask_flare_status_endpoint.py` in this repo for the complete implementation. Key points:

- Reuse your existing forecast/scoring logic
- Return JSON with: score, predicted_flare, score_delta, factors, doses_due
- Use same Bearer token auth as `/api/health-sync`
- Handle insufficient data gracefully

**Test it works:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "https://<YOUR_SERVER>/api/flare-status?user_id=1"
```

Should return JSON like:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "date": "2026-04-05",
  "score": 7.2,
  "predicted_flare": false,
  "score_delta": 2.1,
  "factors": [...],
  "doses_due": [...]
}
```

### 2. Configure Xcode Project (10-15 minutes)

**Follow the checklist in `XCODE_SETUP.md`**, specifically:

#### A. Info.plist Keys
Add these in Xcode → Target → Info tab:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` | Array with one item: `com.biotracking.healthsync.daily` |
| `NSHealthShareUsageDescription` | "Biotracker needs access to your health data to sync steps, heart rate, HRV, sleep temperature, and sun exposure to your personal health tracker." |

#### B. Capabilities
Enable in Xcode → Target → Signing & Capabilities:

- **HealthKit** (with Background Delivery ON)
- **Background Modes** (check "Background processing" only)

#### C. Verify Entitlements
File `healthsync.entitlements` should have:
```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.healthkit</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.developer.healthkit.background-delivery</key>
<true/>
```

### 3. Build and Test (30-60 minutes)

**Quick smoke test:**
1. Run app on your iPhone from Xcode (Cmd+R)
2. Go to Sync tab
3. Tap "Authorize HealthKit" → grant permissions
4. Fill in:
   - Server URL: `https://<YOUR_SERVER>/api/health-sync`
   - API Token: (your token from Flask config)
   - User ID: `1`
5. Tap "Sync Health Data" button
6. Verify: "synced X fields: steps, hrv, ..." appears
7. Switch to Log tab → should load biotracker log page
8. Switch to Risk tab → should load biotracker forecast page

**If that works, you're 99% there!** 🎉

For comprehensive testing (notifications, background sync, etc.), see `TESTING_GUIDE.md`.

## Troubleshooting First Run

### "HealthKit not authorized"
- Make sure you're running on a **real iPhone** (not Simulator)
- Check Health app → Sharing → Apps → healthsync shows permissions
- Verify Info.plist has `NSHealthShareUsageDescription`

### "Sync failed — network error"
- Check Tailscale is connected on iPhone
- Verify server URL has no typos
- Test in Safari first: open `https://<YOUR_SERVER>` manually

### Web views show blank page
- Same as above — Tailscale issue
- Try disconnecting/reconnecting Tailscale
- Check Flask server is running

### No notifications
- Settings → Notifications → healthsync → Allow Notifications (must be ON)
- First launch prompts for permission — if dismissed, need to enable manually
- Tap "Enable Notifications" toggle in app settings to re-prompt

### Background sync doesn't work
- This is normal for first build from Xcode — background tasks work better in TestFlight/production
- To test immediately, use the Xcode debug command (see TESTING_GUIDE.md)
- Check Settings → General → Background App Refresh → healthsync (ON)

## File Reference

Your repo now has these documentation files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Complete system design, data flows, component details |
| `XCODE_SETUP.md` | Xcode project configuration checklist |
| `TESTING_GUIDE.md` | Comprehensive testing procedures |
| `flask_flare_status_endpoint.py` | Server-side API implementation guide |
| `Info.plist.reference` | Example Info.plist keys |
| `README.md` | (this file) Quick start guide |

**Plus your Swift code:**

| File | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `healthsyncApp.swift` | App entry point, registers background tasks |
| `ContentView.swift` | Main TabView (3 tabs) |
| `SyncSettingsView.swift` | Settings + manual sync UI |
| `BioTrackerWebView.swift` | WKWebView wrapper for mobile pages |
| `HealthSyncer.swift` | HealthKit queries + network sync |
| `BackgroundSyncTask.swift` | Automated daily sync via BGTaskScheduler |
| `FlareChecker.swift` | Fetches /api/flare-status, evaluates alerts |
| `NotificationManager.swift` | Schedules all 4 notification types |
| `ShortcutIntents.swift` | iOS Shortcuts actions |

---

## Next Steps After Testing

Once everything works:

1. **Use it daily for a week** — verify background sync, notifications, reliability
2. **Monitor battery usage** — Settings → Battery → healthsync (should be <5% per day)
3. **Create Shortcuts automations** if desired:
   - "Every day at 9 PM → Open Biotracker Log"
   - "When leaving gym → Sync Biotracker"
4. **Optional: TestFlight** — if you want to test background tasks more reliably
5. **Iterate** — adjust notification times, thresholds based on real usage

## What Works Right Now

Even without the Flask endpoint and with minimal Xcode config, these features already work:

✅ Manual HealthKit sync  
✅ Web view access to biotracker  
✅ Settings persistence  
✅ Historical backfill  
✅ HealthKit authorization  

**What needs Flask endpoint:**
- Flare alerts (threshold + trend)
- Med dose reminders (requires doses_due in API response)

**What needs background processing capability:**
- Automatic evening sync (needs Info.plist + capability)
- Scheduled notifications (works once background sync works)

---

## Support

If you hit issues:

1. **Check documentation:**
   - `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for specific test procedures
   - `XCODE_SETUP.md` for configuration help
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` for how everything fits together

2. **Xcode console logs:**
   - Run from Xcode, watch console for error messages
   - Most issues print helpful error text

3. **Verify Flask side:**
   - Check server logs when sync happens
   - Test API endpoints with curl

4. **iOS Settings:**
   - Settings → healthsync → check all permissions
   - Settings → General → Background App Refresh
   - Settings → Notifications → healthsync

---

## Estimated Time to Completion

- **Add Flask endpoint:** 5-10 min
- **Configure Xcode:** 10-15 min
- **First successful sync:** 5 min
- **Test all features:** 30-60 min
- **Total:** 1-2 hours to fully working app

---

## Success Criteria

You'll know everything works when:

✅ Manual sync shows "synced 9 fields: steps, hrv, ..."  
✅ Log and Risk tabs load biotracker pages  
✅ Notification permission granted  
✅ Background sync runs overnight (check "Last auto-sync" timestamp)  
✅ Flare alerts appear when conditions met  
✅ Shortcuts appear in Shortcuts app  
✅ No crashes in normal usage

**You're almost there!** The hard work is done — just need to wire up the server endpoint and verify Xcode config. 🚀
